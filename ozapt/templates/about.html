                    Good day, ladies and gents of osu!za. Phreel here with a huge project that I’ve been planning to do
                    ever since the end of OPT.
                    Welcome to OPT Duos! Before we get into the rules, pools and schedules, have you
                    ever wanted to participate in my showmatches but thought they weren’t inviting enough? Well, the
                    time might have come for you to win! If there’s anything that you are unsure about
                    <strong>AFTER</strong> reading the
                    entire document, feel free to @ me in #tournaments.

                    <ol>
                        <li>This is a 2v2 Double Elimination Tournament.</li>
                        <li>Beatmap scoring is based on ScoreV2.
                        </li>
                        <li>RO16 and Quarter-Finals are both Best of 9. 9th round being the possible TieBreaker if the
                            scores are 4-4. Exceptions are Semi-Finals, Finals and Grand-Finals where the matches are
                            Best of 11 and 13. (Semis BO11, Finals/Grand-Finals BO13)
                        </li>
                        <li>The beatmaps for each round will be announced by myself in advance before the actual matches
                            take place.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the beatmap ends in a draw, the map will be nullified and replayed.</li>
                        <li>Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the map was nullified.</li>
                        <li>Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.</li>
                        <li>Disconnects within 30 seconds after beatmap begin can be aborted and/or rematched. This is
                            up to the referee’s discretion though.
                        </li>
                        <li>The maximum time a scheduled match can be postponed is 10 minutes, after that the opposition
                            would be awarded a default win.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rescheduling of matches must be done 24 hours prior to the match time and evidence of both
                            players agreeing to the changes must be presented to the referee who was assigned to that
                            match.
                        </li>
                        <li>All players are supposed to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive
                            match delays coming from the player’s side can be issued with penalties such as default win
                            or loss.
                        </li>
                        <li>Disrupting the match by foul play, picking inappropriate warmup beatmaps, insulting and
                            provoking other players or referees, delaying the match and other misbehavior is strictly
                            prohibited.
                        </li>
                        <li>The multiplayer chatrooms are subject to the <a target="_blank"

                            Community Rules.</a></li>
                        <li>All players and referees must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and
                            tournament management are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be
                            objected.
                        </li>
                        <li>NoFail <strong>WILL</strong> be used on all maps with no score penalty.</li>
                        <li>All players must pick at least one mod from the following list when playing FreeMod:
                            HardRock
                            (x1.1), Hidden (x1.06), FlashLight (x1.12), Easy (x0.5) or any of these combined.
                        </li>
                        <li>When playing the TieBreaker, mods are optional. Players may go NoMod or any mod listed for
                            FreeMod.
                        </li>
                        <li>Players should do “!roll” right away before the warmups. Higher roll can choose between
                            either
                            “first pick / second ban“ or “first ban / second pick“. The order of picking will
                            depend on the choice of the higher roll. All players can only ban 1 beatmap in the pools.
                        </li>
                        <li>No warmup picks will be played in the qualifiers. In bracket stages, 1 warmup pick, no
                            longer than 4 minutes per team is permitted. If all players agree, warmups can be skipped.
                        </li>
                        <li>This tournament IS NOT restricted to South Africans only. Anyone can register if they joined
                            the osu!za discord server before this announcement.
                        </li>
                        <li>The host and mappoolers cannot join the tournament as players.</li>

                            can be issued if emergencies happen ie. funeral, COVID-19, loadshedding or feeling ill in
                            general.
                        </li>
                        <li>The tournament will start with RO16 (Round of 16).</li>
                        <li><strong><u>To be eligible to register, your global rank has to be lower than 100k. Anyone

                        </li>
                        <li>Since this is a double-elimination tournament, each team would have to have at least
                            <strong>2 losses</strong> to get eliminated. Teams who have lost a match would carry on
                            playing in the Losers Bracket.
                        </li>

                        <li>If there are more than 8 teams then Qualifier Lobbies with different time slots would be
                            provided for them to attend. Team captains can choose whichever one that suits the team
                            the best.
                        </li>
                        <li>A referee will invite the players into a lobby 5 minutes before the scheduled time. If you
                            receive no invitation, then please try to contact the referee on discord. If contacting the
                            referee fails then @ me.
                        </li>
                        <li>If your opponent did not show up 10 minutes after the schedule time for a match, a default
                            win would be issued.

                        <li>If both teams did not show up 10 minutes after the scheduled time for a match, the team
                            with a higher qualifier seeding will advance. No rematches will be tolerated within the
                            tournament.
                        </li>
                        <li>Maximum of 2 minutes (120 seconds) to ban/pick AND to READY up is allowed.</li>
                        <li>There are no restrictions on the ban/picks. Bans can be placed in the same mod pool, and
                            maps from the same mod pool can be picked after each other.

                                From Semi-Finals onwards, the number of bans increases to two/team. However, each
                                team may not ban more than one map of any mod bracket (excluding NoMod).

                            Finals and Grand-Finals. All of these rounds will have their own pools.

                        <li>The tournament uses a TieBreaker system, each team would ban 1 tiebreaker each when both
                            teams are at match point. The TieBreaker that's left after the 2 bans will be played.

                    prize can do it in the form of steam gift cards, games or miscellaneous products.
